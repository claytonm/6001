# 6.001

Solutions to MIT Course 6.001 Projects. All solutions are written in the RSR5 version of Scheme, in the DrScheme development environment.

## Project 1
The first project explores the application of procedures to numeric data. Through the construction of an RSA encryption system, the project covers:

1. higher-order procedures and procedural abstraction,
2. procedural complexity (in both time and space), 
3. recursive and iterative processes, and the
4. substitution model of evaluation.

## Project 2
This project emphasizes higher-order procedures and abstract data types (ADTs). Through the construction of a pattern-matching machine, you learn about: 

1. pairs and lists as building blocks for more elaborate ADTs,
2. the interplay between processes and data types, and
3. symoblic data.
